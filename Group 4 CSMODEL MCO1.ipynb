    "## Process and Implications of Data Collection\n",
    "The data was gathered by means of a survey that was distributed to gamers globally. The survey had a range of inquiries commonly employed by psychologists to assess levels of anxiety, social phobia, and life satisfaction. Standardized psychological assessment instruments, including the General Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWL), and Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) questionnaires, and inquiries regarding gaming habits and general demographics were included in the survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though not explicitly mentioned, it is extremely likely that this survey was conducted online, given that online surveys are commonly used when reaching a worldwide audience, especially gamers. The dataset description also includes *Reddit* as an example for the **Reference** variable, indicating the website was used as an avenue to conduct the survey as well. Assuming the data was collected as such, this presents several implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Composition**: Because the data was collected through an online survey, it may over-represent individuals active in online gaming communities or gamers who primarily play online multiplayer games. As a result, those who do not regularly use the internet, are inactive in online gaming communities, or those who play single-player games exclusively may be underrepresented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Voluntary Response Bias**: The data relies on self-reported responses, which can be subject to biases such as inaccurate self-assessment by the respondent or social desirability bias. Respondents with stronger views also may have been more likely to participate in the first place because of this."

We can apply this data by analyzing this distrubtion, we can identify the proportion of respondents experiencing varying degrees of anxiety, which can help in data gathering and usage. For the Life Satisfaction scores, or the SWL_T, the histogram displays the distribution with a slightly left-skewed shape suggesting most respondents have moderate to high life satisfaction, or they're currently happy with their lives right now. This shows that the overall sample of respondents have a overall well-being. Now for the Social Phobia Scores or SPIN_T, the histogram shows the distribution is a right-skewed shape indicating that most repsondents have a lower social phobia score.

The first graph shows that the peak respondent age is mid-20s, this shows that the age group is highly represented in this sampling, then we have more extremes reaching up to 60, showing that gaming is not a phase but a passion for some people. The second graph shows that majority of the respondents are male, we can use this for mental health data research and in indentifying target demographics.

    "We can see that when comparing Console and PC in terms of GAD_T, our adjusted p-value is 0.66, which is higher than our alpha level of 0.05, therefore being unable to reject the null hypothesis. We can also observe a lower bound of -1.03 and an upper bound of 0.47, resulting in a confidence interval containing zero. This also supports the result that there is no statistically significant difference in gaming-related anxiety levels between the platforms Console and PC.\n",

Our confidence interval does not contain 0 as it is from 0.09 to 5.03. Therefore we reject the null hypothesis and accept that there is a significant difference in gaming-related anxiety levels between the platforms Console and Smartphone / Tablet.\n",

    "Lastly, when comparing PC and to Smartphone / Tablet, we also observe a low p-adj of 0.13 paired with a confidence interval that does not include 0.

    "Upon observing the meandiff between Console and Smartphone / Tablet, we get a value of 2.56. This means that Smartphone / Tablet respondents have higher GAD_T scores compared to that of Console by approximately 2.56 points. Similarly, the meandiff between PC and Smartphone / Tablet is 2.84, meaning that Smartphone / Tablet respondents have higher GAD_T scores by an average of 2.84 points over PC respondents."
