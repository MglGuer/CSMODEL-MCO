    "This project makes use of the [Online Gaming Anxiety Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyansh22/online-gaming-anxiety-data). It contains responses gathered from a worldwide survey of gamers. Included in this survey are psychological assessments for anxiety, social phobia, and life satisfaction. It also gathered demographic and gaming-related information. Marian Sauter and Dejan Draschkow originally compiled the data.\n"

    "The data was gathered by means of a survey that was distributed to gamers globally. The survey had a range of inquiries commonly employed by psychologists to assess levels of anxiety, social phobia, and life satisfaction. Standardized psychological assessment instruments, including the General Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWL), and Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) questionnaires, and inquiries regarding gaming habits and general demographics were included in the survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though not explicitly mentioned, it is extremely likely that this survey was conducted online, given that online surveys are commonly used when reaching a worldwide audience, especially gamers. The dataset description also includes *Reddit* as an example for the **Reference** variable, indicating the website was used as an avenue to conduct the survey as well. Assuming the data was collected as such, this presents several implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Composition**: Because the data was collected through an online survey, it may over-represent individuals active in online gaming communities or gamers who primarily play online multiplayer games. As a result, those who do not regularly use the internet, are inactive in online gaming communities, or those who play single-player games exclusively may be underrepresented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Voluntary Response Bias**: The data relies on self-reported responses, which can be subject to biases such as inaccurate self-assessment by the respondent or social desirability bias. Respondents with stronger views also may have been more likely to participate in the first place because of this."

For the anxiety frequency distribution or the GAD-T, it shows a right-skewed distribution that indicates most repsondents have lower anxiety scores, The distribution helps us understand that anxiety levels are generally low among the respondents, with some outliers experiencing higher levels of anxiety. We can apply this data by analyzing this distrubtion, we can identify the proportion of respondents experiencing varying degrees of anxiety, which can help in data gathering and usage. For the Life Satisfaction scores, or the SWL_T, the histogram displays the distribution with a slightly left-skewed shape suggesting most respondents have moderate to high life satisfaction, or they're currently happy with their lives right now. This shows that the overall sample of respondents have a overall well-being. Now for the Social Phobia Scores or SPIN_T, the histogram shows the distribution is a right-skewed shape indicating that most repsondents have a lower social phobia score. Showing that social anxiety is not a significant issue for most of the respondents, with only a small minority experiencing high levels of social phobia. \n",
