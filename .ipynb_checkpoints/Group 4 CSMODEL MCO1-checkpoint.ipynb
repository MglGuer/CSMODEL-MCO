    "## Process and Implications of Data Collection\n",
    "The data was gathered by means of a survey that was distributed to gamers globally. The survey had a range of inquiries commonly employed by psychologists to assess levels of anxiety, social phobia, and life satisfaction. Standardized psychological assessment instruments, including the General Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWL), and Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) questionnaires, and inquiries regarding gaming habits and general demographics were included in the survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though not explicitly mentioned, it is extremely likely that this survey was conducted online, given that online surveys are commonly used when reaching a worldwide audience, especially gamers. The dataset description also includes *Reddit* as an example for the **Reference** variable, indicating the website was used as an avenue to conduct the survey as well. Assuming the data was collected as such, this presents several implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Composition**: Because the data was collected through an online survey, it may over-represent individuals active in online gaming communities or gamers who primarily play online multiplayer games. As a result, those who do not regularly use the internet, are inactive in online gaming communities, or those who play single-player games exclusively may be underrepresented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Voluntary Response Bias**: The data relies on self-reported responses, which can be subject to biases such as inaccurate self-assessment by the respondent or social desirability bias. Respondents with stronger views also may have been more likely to participate in the first place because of this."

We can apply this data by analyzing this distrubtion, we can identify the proportion of respondents experiencing varying degrees of anxiety, which can help in data gathering and usage. For the Life Satisfaction scores, or the SWL_T, the histogram displays the distribution with a slightly left-skewed shape suggesting most respondents have moderate to high life satisfaction, or they're currently happy with their lives right now. This shows that the overall sample of respondents have a overall well-being. Now for the Social Phobia Scores or SPIN_T, the histogram shows the distribution is a right-skewed shape indicating that most repsondents have a lower social phobia score. Showing that social anxiety is not a significant issue for most of the respondents, with only a small minority experiencing high levels of social phobia. \n",

    "## Explanation:\n",
    "A boxplot is extremely useful here as it displays a range of data and highlights central tendency, and how differeng genres and platforms may affect these.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph shows that in mobile users tend to have GAD_T, SWL_T and SPIN_T scores compared to PC and console users. Interestingly, PC players noticeably have more outliers compared to the rest, leaning towards high GAD_T and SPIN_T.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though there are differences in the median scores, the most striking observations about the game genre graphs are the high amount of outliers presenting high GAD_T and high SPIN_T scores for games like League of Legends and Counter Strike, games known to be highly competitive. This may present an opportunity for feature engineering, classifying the games with regards to how competitive they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Anxiety, Social Phobia and Satisfaction with life tends to be higher for mobile users. High-score outliers are also noticeable with regards to social phobia and anxiety for competitive games."

    "- **Do anxiety, life satisfaction and social phobia have correlations with the game genre the person is playing?**"

    "## Significance\n",
    "We would like to see the correlation of data when it comes to anxiety, life satisfaction, and social phobia when it comes to the game genre. We would like to understand this for a couple of reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mental Health Awareness :  Identifying the potential impact of certain games on mental health can help people veer away from game genres that will worsen their conditions. For example, we wouldn't want an anxious person playing a game that would make them more anxious.\n",
    "2. Game Design : A supporting reason is that game designers could design games that could lessen anxiety, raise life satisfaction and lessen social phobia through games. Sort of a therapeutic experience through gaming.\n",
    "3. Academic Research : As the research has data and statistics backing it up, this could help in to contribute to the broader field of psychology and behavioral studies, providing insights into how modern technology and entertainment affect mental health."
