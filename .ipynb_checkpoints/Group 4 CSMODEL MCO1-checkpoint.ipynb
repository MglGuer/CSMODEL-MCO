    "This project makes use of the [Online Gaming Anxiety Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyansh22/online-gaming-anxiety-data). It contains responses gathered from a worldwide survey of gamers. Included in this survey are psychological assessments for anxiety, social phobia, and life satisfaction. It also gathered demographic and gaming-related information. Marian Sauter and Dejan Draschkow originally compiled the data.\n"

    "## Process and Implications of Data Collection\n",
    "The data was gathered by means of a survey that was distributed to gamers globally. The survey had a range of inquiries commonly employed by psychologists to assess levels of anxiety, social phobia, and life satisfaction. Standardized psychological assessment instruments, including the General Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWL), and Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) questionnaires, and inquiries regarding gaming habits and general demographics were included in the survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though not explicitly mentioned, it is extremely likely that this survey was conducted online, given that online surveys are commonly used when reaching a worldwide audience, especially gamers. The dataset description also includes *Reddit* as an example for the **Reference** variable, indicating the website was used as an avenue to conduct the survey as well. Assuming the data was collected as such, this presents several implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Composition**: Because the data was collected through an online survey, it may over-represent individuals active in online gaming communities or gamers who primarily play online multiplayer games. As a result, those who do not regularly use the internet, are inactive in online gaming communities, or those who play single-player games exclusively may be underrepresented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Voluntary Response Bias**: The data relies on self-reported responses, which can be subject to biases such as inaccurate self-assessment by the respondent or social desirability bias. Respondents with stronger views also may have been more likely to participate in the first place because of this."
